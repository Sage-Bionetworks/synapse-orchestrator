    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall testbed goal is to demonstrate interoperability between multiple workflows running in multiple Workflow Execution Service (WES)-compatible environments. For Toronto, we intend to demonstrate the following: one **workflow** running in one WES-compatible **environment**; the demonstration workflow should nominally be registered in one **workflow library — i.e., tool registry service (TRS)**, and operations will be controlled by one **orchestrator** (represented by the `synorchestrator` library used below).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the testbed app, the orchestrator performs three primary functions:\n",
    "1. makes TRS call to identify and fetch the *checker* workflow for a selected workflow\n",
    "2. makes WES call to run checker workflow\n",
    "3. monitors and reports results\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on checker workflows, refer to the [tutorial](https://docs.dockstore.org/docs/publisher-tutorials/checker-workflows/) in Dockstore.\n"

    "    - workflow *type version* — both CWL and WDL (and other languages that might be supported in the future) are under active developtment; the language version used to produce the workflow of interest will dictate which WES endpoints are compatible for execution\n",
    "- workflow services:\n",
    "    - workflow types & version — a complete list of the workflow types (e.g., CWL, WDL) and respective language versions supported by the WES endpoint will allow the user to select realistic combinations for testing\n",
    "    - filesystem protocol — protocols such as 'http', 'https', 'sftp', 's3', 'gs', 'file', 'synapse', or others as supported by the service; this is **as important** as workflow type and version for ensuring successful execution of workflow-parameter-WES combinations"
